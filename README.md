## Assumptions
I made a few assumptions to complete the project. I would usually ask question before starting the project, but figured since this was just a test, I would assume all the answers.

 - Menu design was for hover and not selected
 - Responsive design (There was no mockups of tablet and phone)
 - CSS and JS Libraries not added (I didn't ad any libraries to show off the code and not my knowledge of known libraries)
